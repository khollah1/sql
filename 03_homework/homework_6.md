**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


Data ethics is one aspect of ethics and equity that guides data practice with respect to collecting, generating, analyzing, and disseminating data that have the potential to adversely impact people and society. This is particularly important with the explosion in the data world.

My experiences vividly illustrate the delicate balance between leveraging data for innovation and ensuring ethical use to protect individuals and society. Having worked as a consumer insight specialist in a competitive industry like telecoms, where data can be a powerful tool, the introduction of data ethics policies initially seemed like a hindrance, impacting revenue and even leading to dismissals in certain cases. It's a stark reminder that data can yield valuable insights but carries significant responsibilities.

I had a colleague who used cell site location data to combat crime, and this highlights the complex ethical considerations involved in data ethics. While the action had positive outcomes, it raised concerns about privacy and regulatory compliance. This underscores the importance of understanding and adhering to legal and ethical frameworks, even in situations where the intentions are noble.
Transitioning to the health sector in Canada, where there's a heightened emphasis on data ethics, provides a contrasting perspective. Here, the focus on protecting personal health information (PHI) is paramount, leading to stringent policies and controls. While these measures may sometimes hinder project progress, they ultimately serve to safeguard individuals' privacy and maintain trust in the healthcare system.

My personal growth in navigating these ethical challenges speaks volumes about my commitment to upholding ethical standards in data practices. Continuously reinforcing my understanding of data ethics and knowing when to draw the line are crucial steps in ensuring responsible data use, both professionally and personally.
